R tools for processing and extracting clinical information from Electronic Medical Records
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This in development package provides tools for accelerating and automating the most common operations researchers perform to extract and analyse data from Electronic Medical Records Databases.  

The package is currently only tested with [CPRD](www.cprd.com) data, but it should be possible to configure it with other EHR data.  See the [ehr_system](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/R/ehr_system.R) code for details of how the interface with CPRD is implemented. See the [vignette](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/vignettes/introduction-to-rehr.pdf) for more details.

The package can be installed from CRAN <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rEHR> or from github using devtools:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
install_github("rEHR", "rOpenHealth")
require(rEHR)
```

See the [vignette](<https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/vignettes/introduction-to-rehr.pdf>) for full usage details. 

Clinical code list construction functions have been absorbed from the [rpcdsearch](<https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rpcdsearch>) package.  See the [Codelist construction vignette]((https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/vignettes/codelists.pdf>) for more details.
